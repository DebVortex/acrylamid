Filters
=======

All transformations your content is done via filters. You an either set them
implicit in *conf.yaml* and/or overriding them in your individual blog posts.  A
filter can convert a Markdown-written text into HTML, render MathML from
AsciiMathML or just increase HTML-headers by one or two. You can specify a filter
by setting the key `filters` to a list of your wished filters, a string with only
one filter, or simply omit the key, if you've already defined a global filter:

::

    ---
    title: Samply Entry
    filters: [reST, hyphenate]
    ---

If you pass conflicting filters like ``reST, Markdown`` the first one gets
applied and the next conflicing ignored. This is useful, when you define a
global filter *Markdown* but also write single entries in e.g.
*reStructuredText*.  Most builtin filters have aliases so you don't have to
remember/write the exact name. Note that the identifier may case-sensitive,
although all builtin filters accept capitalized and lowercase spelling. As an
example, *rst*, *reST* and *restructuredtext* are aliases for
*reStructuredText* (or the other way around).

Some filters may take additional arguments to activate builtin filters like
Markdown's code-hilighting. Not every filter supports additional arguments,
please refer to the filter's arguments for details. The formal syntax is:

::

    filters: [markdown+mathml, summarize+100]
    # or
    filters: [markdown+mathml+codehilite(css_class=highlight), ...]

You can also disable filters applied globally by prefixing them with *no*:

::

    filters: nosummary


Built-in Filters
****************

Markdown
--------

============  ==================================================
Requires      ``markdown`` or (``python-markdown``) -- already
              as a dependency implicitly installed
Aliases       md, mkdown, markdown
Conflicts     HTML, reStructuredText, Pandoc
Arguments     asciimathml (mathml, math), <built-in extensions>
============  ==================================================

Lets write you using Markdown which simplifies HTML generation and is a lot
easier to write. The Markdown filter uses `the official implementation by John
Gruber <http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/>`_ and all it's
`available extensions
<http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Available_Extensions>`_.
*Note*, `pygments <http://pygments.org>`_ is required for `codehilite
<http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/CodeHilite>`_.

Here's an online service converting Markdown to HTML and providing a handy
cheat sheet: `Dingus <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus>`_.

Acrylamid features an `AsciiMathML
<https://github.com/favalex/python-asciimathml>`_ extension. The aliases are:
*asciimathml*, *mathml* and *math* and requires the ``python-asciimathml``
package. Simply ``pip install asciimathml`` and you are done. *Note*, put
your formula into single dollar signs like ``$a+b^2$`` intead of two!

reStructuredText
----------------

============  ==================================================
Requires      ``docutils`` (or ``python-docutils``), optional
              ``pygments`` for syntax highlighting
Aliases       rst, rest, reST, restructuredtext
Conflicts     HTML, Markdown, Pandoc
============  ==================================================

reStructuredText lets you write in reStructuredText syntax instead of HTML.
reStructuredText is more powerful and reliable than Markdown but is also
slower and more difficult to use (but also easier than HTML). Acrylamid offers
three additional directives:

- `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ syntax highlighting via ``code-block``,
  ``sourcecode`` or   ``pygments``. Here's   an example (``linenos`` enables
  line numbering):

  ::

        .. code-block:: python
          :linenos:

          #!/usr/bin/env python
          print "Hello World!

- JavaScript-enabled syntax highlighting via ``code`` and additional scripts:

  ::

      .. source:: python

         #!/usr/bin/env python
         print "Hello, World!"

      .. raw:: html

          <script type="text/javascript" src="http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/scripts/shCore.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript" src="http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/scripts/shBrushPython.js"></script>
          <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/styles/shCoreDefault.css"/>
          <script type="text/javascript">SyntaxHighlighter.defaults.toolbar=false; SyntaxHighlighter.all();</script>

- YouTube directive for easy embedding (key/value pairs are optional of course):

  ::

      .. youtube:: asdfjkl
          width=600
          height=400

pandoc
------

============  ==================================================
Requires      `Pandoc â€“ a universal document converter
              <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ in PATH
Aliases       Pandoc, pandoc
Conflicts     reStructuredText, HTML, Markdown
Arguments     First argument is the FORMAT like Markdown,
              textile and so on. All arguments after that are
              applied as additional long-opts to pandoc.
============  ==================================================


This is filter is a universal converter for various markup language such as
Markdown, reStructuredText, Textile and LaTeX (including special extensions by
pandoc) to HTML. A typical call would look like ``filters:
[pandoc+Markdown+mathml+...]``. You can find a complete list of pandocs
improved (and bugfixed) Markdown in the `Pandoc User's Guide
<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown>`_.

HTML
----

============  ==================================================
Requires      `<built-in>`
Aliases       pass, plain, html, xhtml, HTML
Conflicts     reStructuredText, Markdown, Pandoc
============  ==================================================

No transformation applied. Useful if your text is already written in HTML.

h, head_offset
--------------

============  ==================================================
Requires      <built-in>
Aliases       h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
============  ==================================================

This filter increases HTML headings tag by N whereas N is the suffix of
this filter, e.g. `h2' increases headers by two.

summarize
---------

============  ==================================================
Requires      `<built-in>`
Aliases       sum
Arguments     Maximum words in summarize (an Integer), defaults
              to ``summarize+200``.
============  ==================================================


Summarizes content to make listings of text previews (used in tag/page by default).
You can customize the ellipsis, CSS-class, link-text and the behaviour how the link
appears in your :doc:`conf.py`.

hyphenate
---------

============  ==================================================
Requires      language patterns (ships with `de`,  `en` and
              `fr` patterns)
Aliases       hyphenate, hyph
Arguments     Minimum length before this filter hyphenates the
              word (smallest possible value is four), defaults
              to ``hyphenate+10``.
============  ==================================================

Hyphenates words greater than 10 characters using Frank Liang's algorithm.
Hyphenation pattern depends on the current language of an article (defaulting
to system's locale). Only en, de and fr dictionaries are provided by
Acrylamid. Example usage:

::

    filters: [Markdown, hyphenate, ]
    lang: en

If you need an additional language, `download
<http://tug.org/svn/texhyphen/trunk/hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/txt/>`_
both, ``hyph-*.chr.txt`` and ``hyph-*.pat.txt``, to
*\`sys.prefix\`/lib/python/site-packages/acrylamid/filters/hyph/*.

typography
----------

============  ==================================================
Requires      `smartypants <https://code.google.com/p/typogrify/>`_
Aliases       typography, typo, smartypants
Arguments     all, typo, typogrify, amp, widont, smartypants,
              caps, initial_quotes, number_suffix. Defaults to
              ``typography+amp+widont+smartypants+caps``.
============  ==================================================

Enables typographical transformation to your written content. This includes no
widows, typographical quotes and special css-classes for words written in CAPS
and & (ampersand) to render an italic styled ampersand. See the `original
project <https://code.google.com/p/typogrify/>`_ for more information.

By default *amp*, *widont*, *smartypants*, *caps* are applied. *all*, *typo*
and *typogrify* applying "widont, smartypants, caps, amp, initial_quotes". All
filters are applied in the order as they are written down.

acronyms
--------

============  ==================================================
Requires      `<built-in>`
Aliases       Acronym(s), abbr (both case insensitive)
Arguments     zero to N keys to use from acronyms file, no
              arguments by default (= all acronyms are used)
============  ==================================================

This filter is a direct port of `Pyblosxom's acrynoms plugin
<http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/1.5/plugins/acronyms.html>`_, that marks acronyms
and abbreviations in your text based on either a built-in acronyms list or a
user-specified. To use a custom list just add the FILE to your conf.py like
this:

::

    ACRONYMS_FILE = '/path/to/my/acronyms.txt'


The built-in list of acronyms differs from Pyblosxom's (see
`filters/acronyms.py <https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid/blob/master/acrylam
id/filters/acronyms.py>`_ on GitHub). See the `original description
<http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/1.5/plugins/acronyms.html#building-the-
acronyms-file>`_ of how to make an acronyms file!

jinja2
------

============  ==================================================
Requires      `<built-in>`
Aliases       Jinja2, jinja2
============  ==================================================

In addition to HTML templating you can also use `Jinja2
<http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ in your postings, which may be useful when
implementing a image gallery or other repeative tasks.

Within jinja you have a custom ``system``-filter which allows you to call
something like ``ls`` directly in your content (use it with care, when you
rebuilt this content, the output might differ).

::

    ---
    title: "Jinja2's system filter"
    filters: jinja2
    ---

    Take a look at my code:

    .. code-block:: python

        {{ "cat ~/work/project/code.py" | system | indent(4) }}

Environment variables are the same as in :doc:`templating`.


Custom Filters
**************

Acrylamid can easily be extended with self-written filters inside your blog
directory (``filters/`` per default). Do write your own filter, take a look
at the code of `already existing filters
<https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid/acrylamid/filters>`_ shipped with
acrylamid and also visiting `doc: Extending Acrylamid`.
